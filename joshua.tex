  We describe improvements made over the past year to Joshua, an
  open-source translation system for parsing-based machine
  translation. The main contributions this past year are significant
  improvements in both speed and usability of the grammar extraction
  and decoding steps. We have also rewritten the decoder to use a
  sparse feature representation, enabling training of large numbers of
  features with discriminative training methods.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

Joshua is an open-source toolkit\footnote{\url{joshua-decoder.org}}
for hierarchical and syntax-based statistical machine translation of
human languages with synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs).  The original version of Joshua \cite{Joshua-WMT} was
a port (from Python to Java) of the Hiero machine translation system
introduced by \newcite{Chiang2007}.  It was later extended to support
grammars with rich syntactic labels \cite{li2010joshua}. Subsequent
efforts produced Thrax, the extensible Hadoop-based extraction tool
for synchronous context-free grammars \cite{Joshua-3.0}, later
extended to support pivoting-based paraphrase extraction
\cite{Joshua-4.0}. Joshua 5.0 continues our yearly update cycle. 

The major components of Joshua 5.0 are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\S\ref{sec:sparse}] \emph{Sparse features}. Joshua now supports an
    easily-extensible sparse feature implementation, along with tuning
    methods (PRO and kbMIRA) for efficiently setting the weights on
    large feature vectors.
  \item[\S\ref{sec:performance}] \emph{Significant speed
    increases}. Joshua 5.0 is up to six times faster than Joshua 4.0,
    and also does well against hierarchical Moses, where end-to-end
    decoding (including model loading) of WMT test sets is as much as
    three times faster.
  \item[\S\ref{sec:thrax}] \emph{Thrax 2.0}. Our reengineered
    Hadoop-based grammar extractor, Thrax, is up to 300\% faster while
    using significantly less intermediate disk space.
  \item[\S\ref{sec:other}] \emph{Many other features}. Joshua now
    includes a server mode with fair round-robin scheduling among and
    within requests, a bundler for distributing trained models,
    improvements to the Joshua pipeline (for managing end-to-end
    experiments), and better documentation.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Overview}

Joshua is an end-to-end statistical machine translation toolkit. In
addition to the decoder component (which performs the actual
translation), it includes the infrastructure needed to prepare and
align training data, build translation and language models, and tune
and evaluate them.

This section provides a brief overview of the contents and abilities
of this toolkit. More information can be found in the online
documentation (\url{joshua-decoder.org/5.0/}).

\subsection{The Pipeline: Gluing it all together}

The Joshua pipeline ties together all the infrastructure needed to
train and evaluate machine translation systems for research or
industrial purposes. Once data has been segmented into parallel
training, development, and test sets, a single invocation of the
pipeline script is enough to invoke this entire infrastructure from
beginning to end. Each step is broken down into smaller steps (e.g.,
tokenizing a file) whose dependencies are cached with SHA1 sums. This
allows a reinvoked pipeline to reliably skip earlier steps that do not
need to be recomputed, solving a common headache in the research and
development cycle.

The Joshua pipeline is similar to other ``experiment management
systems'' such as Moses' Experiment Management System (EMS), a much
more general, highly-customizable tool that allows the specification
and parallel execution of steps in arbitrary acyclic dependency graphs
(much like the \textsc{Unix} \verb|make| tool, but written with
machine translation in mind). Joshua's pipeline is more limited in
that the basic pipeline skeleton is hard-coded, but reduced
versatility covers many standard use cases and is arguably easier to
use.

The pipeline is parameterized in many ways, and all the options below
are selectable with command-line switches. Pipeline documentation is
available online.

\subsection{Data preparation, alignment, and model building}

Data preparation involves data normalization (e.g., collapsing certain
punctuation symbols) and tokenization (with the Penn treebank or
user-specified tokenizer).  Alignment with GIZA++ \cite{giza} and the
Berkeley aligner \cite{berkeley-aligner} are supported.

Joshua's builtin grammar extractor, Thrax, is a Hadoop-based
extraction implementation that scales easily to large
datasets \cite{PPDB}.  It supports extraction of both Hiero
\cite{Chiang2005} and SAMT grammars \cite{samt2006} with extraction
heuristics easily specified via a flexible configuration file. The
pipeline also supports GHKM grammar extraction
\cite{galley2006scalable} using the extractors available from Michel
Galley\footnote{\url{nlp.stanford.edu/~mgalley/software/stanford-ghkm-latest.tar.gz}}
or Moses.

SAMT and GHKM grammar extraction require a parse tree, which are
produced using the Berkeley parser \cite{petrov2006learning}, or can
be done outside the pipeline and supplied as an argument.

\subsection{Decoding}

The Joshua decoder is an implementation of the CKY+ algorithm
\cite{chappelier1998generalized}, which generalizes CKY by removing
the requirement that the grammar first be converted to Chomsky Normal
Form, thereby avoiding the complexities of explicit binarization
schemes \cite{zhang2006synchronous,denero2009asynchronous}. CKY+
maintains cubic-time parsing complexity (in the sentence length) with
Earley-style implicit binarization of rules. Joshua permits arbitrary
SCFGs, imposing no limitation on the rank or form of grammar rules.

Parsing complexity is still exponential in the scope of the
grammar,\footnote{Roughly, the number of consecutive nonterminals in a
  rule \cite{hopkins2010scfg}.} so grammar filtering remains
important.  The default Thrax settings extract only grammars with rank
2, and the pipeline implements scope-3 filtering \cite{hopkins2010scfg}
when filtering grammars to test sets (for GHKM).

Joshua uses cube pruning \cite{Chiang2007} with a default pop limit of
100 to efficiently explore the search space. Other decoder options are
too numerous to mention here, but are documented online.

\subsection{Tuning and testing}

The pipeline allows the specification (and optional linear
interpolation) of an arbitrary number of language models.  In
addition, it builds an interpolated Kneser-Ney language model on the
target side of the training data using KenLM
\cite{KenLM,Heafield-estimate}, BerkeleyLM \cite{BerkeleyLM} or SRILM
\cite{SRILM}. 

Joshua ships with MERT \cite{Och2003} and PRO implementations.  Tuning
with k-best batch MIRA \cite{cherry2012batch} is also supported via
callouts to Moses.

\section{What's New in Joshua 5.0}

\subsection{Sparse features}
\label{sec:sparse}

Until a few years ago, machine translation systems were for the most
part limited in the number of features they could employ, since the
line-based optimization method, MERT \cite{Och2003}, was not able to
efficiently search over more than tens of feature weights.  The
introduction of discriminative tuning methods for machine translation
\cite{liang2006end,tillmann-zhang:2006:COLACL,chiang2008online,PRO2011}
has made it possible to tune large numbers of features in statistical
machine translation systems, and open-source implementations such as
\newcite{cherry2012batch} have made it easy.

Joshua 5.0 has moved to a sparse feature representation
internally. First, to clarify terminology, a feature as implemented in
the decoder is actually a template that can introduce any number of
actual features (in the standard machine learning sense). We will use
the term \emph{feature function} for these templates and
\emph{feature} for the individual, traditional features that are
induced by these templates. For example, the (typically dense)
features stored with the grammar on disk are each separate features
contributed by the \textsc{PhraseModel} feature function template. The
\textsc{LanguageModel} template contributes a single feature value for
each language model that was loaded.

For efficiency, Joshua does not store the entire feature vector during
decoding.  Instead, hypergraph nodes maintain only the best cumulative
score of each incoming hyperedge, and the edges themselves retain only
the hyperedge delta (the inner product of the weight vector and
features incurred by that edge).  After decoding, the feature vector
for each edge can be recomputed and explicitly represented if that
information is required by the decoder (for example, during tuning).

This functionality is implemented via the following feature function
interface, presented here in simplified pseudocode:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  interface FeatureFunction:
    apply(context, accumulator)
\end{verbatim}
%
The \verb|context| comprises fixed pieces of the input sentence and
hypergraph:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item the hypergraph edge (which represents the SCFG rule and sequence
  of tail nodes)
\item the complete source sentence
\item the input span
\end{itemize}
%
The \verb|accumulator| object's job is to accumulate feature
(name,value) pairs fired by a feature function during the application of a
rule, via another interface:
%
\begin{verbatim}
  interface Accumulator:
    add(feature_name, value)
\end{verbatim}
%
The accumulator generalization\footnote{Due to Kenneth Heafield.}
permits the use of a single feature-gathering function for two
accumulator objects: the first, used during decoding, maintains only a
weighted sum, and the second, used (if needed) during k-best
extraction, holds onto the entire sparse feature vector.

For tuning large sets of features, Joshua supports both PRO
\cite{PRO2011}, an in-house version introduced with Joshua 4.0, and
k-best batch MIRA \cite{cherry2012batch}, implemented via calls to
code provided by Moses.

\subsection{Performance improvements}
\label{sec:performance}

We introduced many performance improvements, replacing code designed
to get the job done under research timeline constraints with more
efficient alternatives, including smarter handling of locking among
threads, more efficient (non string-based) computation of dynamic
programming state, and replacement of fixed class-based array
structures with fixed-size literals.

We used the following experimental setup to compare Joshua 4.0 and
5.0: We extracted a large German-English grammar from all sentences
with no more than 50 words per side from Europarl v.7
\cite{koehn2005europarl}, News Commentary, and the Common Crawl
corpora using Thrax default settings.  After filtering against our
test set (newstest2012), this grammar contained 70 million rules.  We
then trained three language models on (1) the target side of our
grammar training data, (2) English Gigaword, and (3) the monolingual
English data released for WMT13. We tuned a system using kbMIRA and
decoded using KenLM \cite{KenLM}.  Decoding was performed on 64-core
2.1 GHz AMD Opteron processors with 256 GB of available memory.

Figure~\ref{fig:cmp} plots the end-to-end runtime\footnote{i.e.,
  including model loading time and grammar sorting} as a function of
the number of threads.  Each point in the graph is the minimum of at
least fifteen runs computed at different times over a period of a few
days.  The main point of comparison, between Joshua 4.0 and 5.0, shows
that the current version is up to 500\% faster than it was last year,
especially in multithreaded situations.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{plots/runtimes.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{End-to-end runtime as a function of the number of threads.
    Each data point is the minimum of at least fifteen different
    runs.}
  \label{fig:cmp}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{plots/decoding-only.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Decoding time alone.}
  \label{fig:decoding-only}
\end{figure}

For further comparison, we took these models, converted them to
hierarchical Moses format, and then decoded with the latest
version.\footnote{The latest version available on Github as of June 7,
  2013} We compiled Moses with the recommended optimization
settings\footnote{With tcmalloc and the following compile flags:
  \texttt{--max-factors=1 --kenlm-max-order=5 debug-symbols=off}} and
used the in-memory (SCFG) grammar format.  BLEU scores were
similar.\footnote{22.88 (Moses), 22.99 (Joshua 4), and 23.23 (Joshua
  5).}  In this end-to-end setting, Joshua is about 200\% faster than
Moses at high thread counts (Figure~\ref{fig:cmp}).

Figure \ref{fig:decoding-only} furthers the Moses and Joshua
comparison by plotting only decoding time (subtracting
out model loading and sorting times).  Moses' decoding speed is 2--3
times faster than Joshua's, suggesting that the end-to-end gains in
Figure~\ref{fig:cmp} are due to more efficient grammar loading.

\subsection{Thrax 2.0}
\label{sec:thrax}

The Thrax module of our toolkit has undergone a similar overhaul. The
rule extraction code was rewritten to be easier to understand and
extend, allowing, for instance, for easy inclusion of alternative
nonterminal labeling strategies.

      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Comparing Hadoop's intermediate disk space use and
    extraction time on a selection of Europarl v.7 Hiero grammar
    extractions. Disk space was measured at its maximum, at
    the input of Thrax's final grammar aggregation stage. Runtime was
    measured on our Hadoop cluster with a capacity of 52 mappers and
    26 reducers. On average Thrax 2.0, bundled with Joshua 5.0,
    is up to 300\% faster and more compact.}
  \label{tab-thrax-speed}
\end{table*}

We optimized the data representation used for the underlying
map-reduce framework towards greater compactness and speed, resulting
in a 300\% increase in extraction speed and an equivalent reduction in
disk I/O (Table~\ref{tab-thrax-speed}).  These gains enable us to
extract a syntactically labeled German-English SAMT-style translation grammar
from a bitext of over 4 million sentence pairs in just over three
hours.  Furthermore, Thrax 2.0 is capable of scaling to very large data
sets, like the composite bitext used in the extraction of the
paraphrase collection PPDB \cite{PPDB}, which counted 100 million
sentence pairs and over 2 billion words on the English side.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[ width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/rich_context.pdf}
  \caption{Here, position-aware lexical and part-of-speech $n$-gram
    features, labeled dependency links, and features reflecting the
    phrase's CCG-style label $\mathit{NP/NN}$ are included in the
    context vector.}\label{fig-rich-context}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, Thrax 2.0 contains a module focused on the extraction of
compact distributional signatures over large datasets.  This
\emph{distributional} mode collects contextual features for $n$-gram
phrases, such as words occurring in a window around the phrase, as
well as dependency-based and syntactic
features.  Figure~\ref{fig-rich-context} illustrates the feature
space. We then compute a bit signature from the resulting feature
vector via a randomized locality-sensitive hashing projection.  This
yields a compact representation of a phrase's typical context. To
perform this projection Thrax relies on the Jerboa toolkit
\cite{Jerboa}. As part of the PPDB effort, Thrax has been used to
extract rich distributional signatures for 175 million 1-to-4-gram
phrases from the Annotated Gigaword corpus \cite{annotated-gigaword},
a parsed and processed version of the English Gigaword
\cite{Gigaword}.

Thrax is distributed with Joshua and is also available as a separate
download.\footnote{\url{github.com/joshua-decoder/thrax}}

\subsection{Other features}
\label{sec:other}

Joshua 5.0 also includes many features designed to increase its
usability.  These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A TCP/IP server architecture, designed to handle multiple sets
  of translation requests while ensuring fairness in thread assignment
  both across and within these connections.
\item Intelligent selection of translation and language model training
  data \cite{moore2010intelligent,axelrod-he-gao:2011:EMNLP} using
  cross-entropy difference to rank training candidates
  \cite{orland-taus}.
\item A bundler for easy packaging of trained models with
  all of its dependencies.
\item A year's worth of improvements to the Joshua pipeline, including many
  new features and supported options, and increased robustness to error.
\item Extended documentation.
\end{itemize}

\section{WMT Submissions}

We submitted a constrained entry for all tracks except English-Czech
(nine in total). Our systems were constructed in a straightforward
fashion and without any language-specific adaptations using the Joshua
pipeline. For each language pair, we trained a Hiero system on all
sentences with no more than fifty words per side in the Europarl, News
Commentary, and Common Crawl corpora. We built two interpolated Kneser-Ney language
models: one from the monolingual News Crawl corpora (2007--2012), and
another from the target side of the training data.  For systems
translating into English, we added a third language model built on
Gigaword. Language models were combined linearly into a single
language model using interpolation weights from the tuning data
(newstest2011).  We tuned our systems with kbMIRA. For truecasing, 
we used a monolingual translation system built on the training data,
and finally detokenized with simple heuristics.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Summary}

The 5.0 release of Joshua is the result of a significant year-long
research, engineering, and usability effort that we hope will be of
service to the research community. User-friendly packages of Joshua
are available from \url{joshua-decoder.org}, while developers are
encouraged to participate via
\url{github.com/joshua-decoder/joshua}. Mailing lists, linked from the
main Joshua page, are available for both.
